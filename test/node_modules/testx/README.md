## What is testx?
Testx is a library for executing keyword driven tests with Protractor. It provides a very simple abstraction for writing logicless test scripts. A **testx** test script is just a list of steps, that are executed in sequence. Each step performs an action and/or checks the state of the application under test against expected conditions. This intuitive concept makes the tests easy to write and read. While **testx** is built on top of Protractor it does not require programming knowledge. For example:

in Protractor you do:

```javascript
browser.get('https://www.google.com');
element(by.name('q')).sendKeys('testx.io');
element(by.css("button[name='btnG']")).click();
expect(element(by.linkText('testxio Â· GitHub')).elementIsVisible).toBeTruthy();
```
in testx you do this instead:
```
- go to:
    url: 'https://www.google.com'
- set:
    name('q'): testx.io
    css("button[name='btnG']"):
- wait to appear:
    el1: resultLink
```
*Explaination*:
By using build-in core **testx keywords** `go to`, testx passes the provided *url* to Protractor's `browser.get()` function. The `set` keyword will execute `element(by...)` function depending on the parameters used. In this case it first executes `element(by.name())`, because a string is provided `testx.io`it will also run `sendKeys()` and parse the provided string to the function. Leave it emply, `set` keyword it will run `click.()` on the element. 


## How does it work
**testx** aims to make web application testing easier by using keyword driven testing.

**testx** uses YAML files as a platform for writing tests. 

- **YAML** (*.testx, .yaml, .yml*):
	- Pros
		- Simple text based format. Version management is a breeze.
		- Syntax highlighting and auto-complete support (at least for the core keywords) via an [Atom plugin](http://testx.io/atom-language-testx) if you use *.testx* file extension.
	- Cons
		- No logic in the script itself. For example, if you need a random string, you have to implement it via a function or pass it through the initial test context.



### Test structure
The tests consist of *steps*. Each step consists of a *keyword* and *arguments*.

The keyword is an action or a check (or both, can be anything really).
The arguments consist of a name and a value. Both the name and the value can be literals, context references or object keys.

For example the test script below does a search on a website and check if the search result is expected.
```
- go to:
    url: / 
- set:
    search-btn:
	query-input: 'new york'
- wait to appear
    el1: resultLink
	timeout: 4000
- check matches:
	resultLink: 'New York'
```
The `url` is pre-define as `baseUrl` in the config file. `search-btn` and `resultLink` are objects that are pre-defined in a separate document. You can think them as *variables* that are defined else where.  

#### Keywords
You can think of the step as the action you want to perform using the provided arguments.
In this context the keyword is the action.

#### Objects
The other key component at work here is the **object map**.

It is a dictionary of *object keys* - the stuff you put in your scripts to identify objects on the screen - and *object locators*. Think of them as a dictonary of page objects assigned as variables to use in your test script. So instead of 
```
- set:
    name('q'): testx.io
    css("button[name='btnG']"):
```
You define them in a separate coffee file first, for example in `objects/index.coffee`:
```coffeescript
module.exports =
  "query-input":
    locator: "css"
    value: "input[name='q']"
  "search-btn":
    locator: "css"
    value: "button[name='btnG']"
  "result-link":
    locator: "css"
    value: "li.g a"
```
Then include them by use **addObjects** method in the `conf.coffee` file:
```coffeescript
testx = require `testx`
onPrepare: ->
	testx.objects.add require('./objects')
```
And then call them within your test script:
```
- go to:
    url: / 
- set:
    search-btn:
	query-input: 'new york'
- wait to appear
    el1: resultLink
	timeout: 4000
- check matches:
	resultLink: 'New York'
```

Object locators are simple objects consisting of *locator* and *value*.

The locator can be any of the supported protractor element selector types, i.e. *id*, *css*, *xpath*, etc.

The value is the actual value of the selector - "element-id", ".hidden.button", "//input[@type='button']", etc.

You can expand the page objects by creating separate coffee files for each page and include them in your `conf.coffee`. 

#### Behaviours
**testx** does its magic by augmenting the behaviour to the WebDriver elements. This is done by adding 3 functions to the WebDriver element:
 - **set** - used to act on element uniformly. Mainly used by the **set** keyword.
 - **get** - used to get the *perceived value* of the element. Mainly used by the **check ...** keywords.
 - **wait** - used to wait for element state. Mainly used by the **wait ...** keywords.

As of **testx 1.5.0** it is possible to add custom behaviour to objects in the object map. This is done by adding a *behaviour* attribute to the object definition. The *behaviour* is an object containing **get**, **set** and/or **wait** functions specific to this object. All these are optional - if omitted, the default behaviour will be used instead.

For example

	"query-input":
		locator: "css"
		value: "input[name='q']"
		behaviour:
			set: (val) -> @sendKeys val

will override the **set** function for only that particular object. The **this (@)** object in the function is the instance of the WebDriver element. The **get** and **wait** functions for this object will take the defaults.

## Prerequisites

**testx** will only work in protractor based projects. Supported protractor versions are 2.0.0 and up.

## Installation

Create a protractor project. For a sample project clone https://github.com/testxio/testx-quickstart

Add this module to your project:

	npm install testx --save

This is already done in the sample project so there you only need to:

	npm install

## Run

From within the test project directory:

	protractor conf.coffee --baseUrl=http://google.com

## Configuration

All **testx** configuration lives in your protractor configuration file under *params.testx*, for example (in coffeescript):
```coffeescript
params:
  testx:
    logScript: true
    actionTimeout: 4000
```
The available configuration options are
 - **logScript** - if *true* **testx** will log the test script (JSON) on the console before executing it; defaults to *false*.
 - **actionTimeout** - the timeout in milliseconds before a *get* or *set* action will fail, for example because the target element is not visible; defaults to 5000.

It is also possible (since testx@2.4.0) to provide configuration directly in your *package.json* file. In this case you need to add the **testx** parameters under a *testx* field in your *package.json*, for example:

```
...
"testx": {
	"logScript": true
	"actionTimeout": 4000
}
...
```

The configuration parameters specified in the protractor configuration (config file or command line) take precedence over the ones specified in *package.json*.

## Core keywords

**testx** comes with a simple set keywords that can be extended/overriden from the project.
See the **keywords.add** method for details.

Predefined keywords are:

*object key* - the object key as specified in the object map. The keyword is applied to this object (DOM element).
*value of the object* - this string value depends on the HTML type of the object. For example it will be the text of a label or the value attribute of an input element.
